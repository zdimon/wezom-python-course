f a valid align value is specified, 
it can be preceded by a fill character 
that can be any character and defaults 
to a space if omitted. It is not possible 
to use a literal curly brace (or) 
as the fill character in a formatted string 
literal or when using the str.format() method. 
However, it is possible to insert a curly brace 
with a nested replacement field. This limitation 
does not affect the format() function.
